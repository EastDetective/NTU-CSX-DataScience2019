Absolutely best icons i ever seen in my life :D Congrats for your appetite. Icons look awesome! Have sort of the same setup, but macos icons, i'd love to use yours, when you finish them ! I neeeeeeeed it. Can you share your icon theme that has icons for dolphin toolbar buttons and directories? Or can you use github for your icon theme? It looks really nice. I need your icons too! I am not a big fan of icons, to me they are just means to an end, your icons kind sir, are magestic! Please help a brother in despair!!! How did you achieve the blur effect? That should do the trick. Nope didn't work. That is weird... It's a kvantum theme plasma Are you using XRender backend? How did you get dolphin to work like that? With everything on the left side panel? Umm, you can move toolbar to the left/right side of the window, just unlock it and drag, it's possible in most of the KDE apps Wow!

unixporn,[i3-gaps] Neon Pyramids,"The first neon wallpaper I like. The soft grain also fits. I've been a long time lurker, but here is my first rice. Somewhat copied from one I saw earlier this week, which gave me inspiration to post.

Thanks, didn‚Äôt realize I was using the fancy pants editor. I like it a lot. I want to imitate it on my system. In your dots can you give the config files for compton and polybar and all that? Very beautiful ! Could you post your polybar config on github bro ? :D Have you tried Fedora 29? I'm thinking of switch from Ubuntu 18.10 to Fedora. That's too much transparency for me to the point where it looks impractical to use, but I dig the color scheme and the wallpaper. Nice rice! That‚Äôs what my original thoughts were when I set the transparency so low, but when the windows are in focus then it‚Äôs actually not that much. I think in focus I have it set to 85% or 90%. The color was on point! I use a very neon colorscheme in vim and in my terminal. The pyramids made me think of it. simply beautiful!"
unixporn,[awesome] (¬¥ÔΩ°‚Ä¢ ·µï ‚Ä¢ÔΩ°`) ‚ô°,"That looks super clean wallpaper awesome config vim-startify The wallpaper looks like Ilya Kuvshinov's style. Pretty sure it IS one of his drawings. Ducking perfect How hard is awesome to get into when compared to other wms? It's the same as any other wm you configure with a programming language (like xmonad or dwm). If you don't like programming, go with a DSL-configured wm like i3. I love awesome though. You can be very expressive with lua. kakeregui"

unixporn,[i3] Colors!,"I dig it. Uovote for lack of shitty anime background well . i almost upload that has neofetch with anime gurl image . but i get rid of it and use their logo instead. Don't ever speak to me again vile degenerate. He literally links to some hardcore anime forum in the description. I guess it's a lost cause. I say we burn him Yup. Got my flamethrower. Oh God don't check his post or comment history guys wtf Okayyy seems like OP is an anime furry degenerate NixNest gang yeah the shitty anime and lolli bs gets old! Downvoat for every single app being completely useless That's my kind of desktop: no transparency, no gaps exposing a distracting background image. Just simple and clean, no wasted space so I can get shit done. Don't get me wrong I love the look of some of the ""ricier"" desktops here and think ""pretty! ...but impractical."" I can better focus on what I'm doing with gaps. For me gaps are giving more pronounced division between windows and I am so used to seeing desktop wallpaper (it make sense to me). Not so much wasted space. That's the point of ricing, form over function The best rice is the synthesis of form and function, not a choice of one over the other.

Thank you so much! https://i.imgur.com/srgaGVB.png Looking great! .Your welcome Wonderful color choices, I'm not one for lighter vibrant colors but those do all fit together very nicely. Next step is a flatter, more modern looking bar to match everything else :) yeah i also thought about that. do you have any bar recommendation? I can personally vouch for polybar but I've also heard lemonbar is good I use polybar. A little complicated to configure, but you can find a few configs on this sub. It's ironic that i3 is touted as Manager for productivity and everything shown in this photo managed by it is a completely useless application omg I love this. I might steal it. yes 2800 packages? i think most of it came from 32 bit wine install. even though i never used it. I was just about to say that very nice does that neofetch image have alpha transparency or is that solid background color around the L & R? thats png image . yes it's transparent thank you! I'll have no problem editing pics in gimp along those terms This looks amazing Got to dig this! Got git? not yet . but i'll make one there you go fhadiel/F0x48 very eye pleasing color scheme.

unixporn,[TTY] Did you know you can customize the TTY login screen?,"Did you know that you can play videos using VLC in ASCII mode? $ vlc -V caca *mp4 or, for users with those fancy high-resolution VGA graphics cards: $ vlc -V fb *mp4 I did not know about ASCII mode, but I did know about fb mode. VLC is a pretty cool app! Just tried it, but it give weird errors about failing to create video output (maybe because I'm using i3-gaps?). Can you only play certain videos or anything should works ? The fb one only works in the TTY. Libcaca should work though, assuming it was compiled in. Thanks I ll try again tonight in tty to see Details I switched over to using console-TDM as my display manager a while back because there was some kind of vulnerability in X11 that could be avoided by running X11 as a normal user rather than root. At the time SDDM (which I was using) didn't have anything in place to fix this (not sure if this is still the case). I probably would have used CDM instead, but I couldn't get it to work, unfortunately. At any rate, I don't mind TDM so much, but I felt like the console login screen was kind of boring, so I decided to figure out how to customize it. Apparently the customization happens in /etc/issue (In openSUSE, this is a symlink to /run/issue). It's not too difficult, but you apparently can't just type in ansi escape sequences, so you have to know how to insert those in your text editor. In nano you do escape v escape (please don't downvote me for using nano for this). Wasn't able to find out how to do this in kate, unfortunately. You can definitely also do it in vim and emacs. Here is what mine looks like: ^[[H^[[2J ^[[0;33m    Welcome to ^[[1;32m                                    ******** **     **  ******** ******** ^[[0;32m          ******                 ^[[1;32m  **////// /**    /** **////// /**///// ^[[0;32m  ****** /**///**  *****  *******^[[1;32m /**       /**    /**/**       /** ^[[0;32m **////**/**  /** **///**//**///**^[[1;32m/*********/**    /**/*********/******* ^[[0;32m/**   /**/****** /******* /**  /**^[[1;32m////////**/**    /**////////**/**//// ^[[0;32m/**   /**/**///  /**////  /**  /**^[[1;32m       /**/**    /**       /**/** ^[[0;32m//****** /**     //****** ***  /**^[[1;32m ******** //*******  ******** /******** ^[[0;32m //////  //       ////// ///   // ^[[1;32m////////   ///////  ////////  //////// ^[[1;33m    Tumbleweed ^[[1;31m    \d ^[[0;35m\t ^[[1;37m    kernel \r (\l).^[[0m The ansi escapes here look like ^[. Getty also has some escapes that are just regular old \ More information Can you clarify this: console-TDM is a display manager of multiple choices of DM at console? - so we can choose one and using it as wm, e.g: console-TDM display i3, dwm.. and let we choose one to use? Another question: what is your console font? I really want to use console only too. Console-TDM requires xorg-xinit on archlinux distro, does that mean I still need to install x11 - xorg-server to make it work? Do you mind to share your prompt? console-TDM is essentially an ncurses wrapper for startx. You put it in .profile so that it launches when you log in. It gives you a list of window managers and/or desktop environments to choose from (sometimes you need to add these manually, although tdmctl makes this pretty easy). If you want to use the console you just choose ""cancel"" instead of ""okay."" This is probably why you need xinit installed to use it, as if you aren't launching X there's not much point (though there might be a way to get it to run scripts other than startx like shutdown, reboot, etc. I haven't dug that deep yet. I do remember doing something like that for a display manager a while back, probably slim, though I can't remember). My console font is most likely just the default, as I think I've only ever customized in under X11. PS1 is \e[0;31m‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ\e[1;32m[\u@\h]\e[0;31m‚îÄ\e[0;36m[\D{%d %b} \A]\e[0;31m‚îÄ\e[0;33m[\w]\n\e[0;31m‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ïº \e[1;36m\$\[$(tput sgr0)\] You can compile only login .c from util-linux and replace it with your /usr/bin/login or with using ‚Äîlogin-program path/to/your/edited/compiled/login.c ‚Äîskip-login parameters in getty-systemd service files you can achieve any kind of login prompt like mine : Username: Password: Editing /etc/issue known method and technically this is not editing login prompt at all Just check man agetty Okay, fair enough. But it's still customized so that it looks different from how it did before (also so that it clears the screen before displaying the new prompt). Good enough for me. no shit"

I think some fonts are not installed on my system https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes/tree/master/polybar-1/fonts these are from the repository I got the config from.

unixporn,[DDE] Manjaro Deepin Rice,"Wow, looks amazing! The UI and layout reminds me a lot of Windows 10, except this actually looks good, and is consistent with itself. :) Yes! The UI is consistent in every app. And the panel has 2 modes. The other one looks like a normal linux dock. A lot of this stuff looks just as good on a default Manjaro Deepin install, that's why I liked it so much. It's naturally a lot nicer than most desktops, and speedy too. I really don't like Windows 10 personally though. This is a much nicer look. Yea, Windows 10's visuals suffer from two major issues: Having to support a ton of legacy code, meaning a lot of things have yet to be updated past the old Win95 (win32) looks. Having been designed and developed over the course of multiple design philosophies, so the design language is fractured. (Assumption) Dev teams not communicating properly, meaning that they don't necessarily follow the same design guide lines, as evident by some UWP apps being inconsistent with eachother. I use Windows (shame on me), since I am a Windows developer (work and freetime), and also enjoy video games, and I'm generally happy with Win10. But there's no point denying that Linux installations can look significantly better (and significantly worse) than Windows does. And lightweight Linux distros can revive old computers that struggle to run Windows (my old laptop currently runs Ubuntu (wanted to test Skyrim on a laptop that really shouldn't be used for gaming), but I'm writing an script to install Arch32 on it, so it can quickly be used for light web browsing). Sure but you should try Linux on a modern computer. A lot of people try it on older computers only, which affects their judgment quite a bit. On modern computers its even more impressive. And I game on Linux these days. Check out protondb. :) I have tried it, and enjoyed it, but I do prefer Windows for my use cases. I wish I could go full Linux, but I missed having access to the things I enjoy without having to compromise on performance. I wish you could combine the comparability of Windows with the flexibility of Linux, and get the best of both worlds. For now, I'll stick with Windows on my desktop, and Linux on my laptop. Manjaro Deepin Rice You misspelt: Default Deepin DE (I just changed the wallpaper) Yeah, I'm not a huge fan of low effort posts either. I mean, I'm glad these people are exited about their desktop environments and window managers but I come to /r/unixporn for a different kind of content. In my opinion, 1000 i3 """"rices"""" everyday are low effort. What's even worse, they're all similar looking with just different colors. Well, not much you can do in Deepin. True, but look at the post rules. Not that Deepin is not gorgeous DE. So, should i remove this post? Nope, it is ok. You have a relatively new account so I assume you are new to Reddit ‚Äî next time just read rules before posting. I don‚Äôt think this sub, in particular, is very snobby, but in some others, you might get banned for not following them. Also, RICE refers to deeper personalization ‚Äî saying Deepin RICE is sort of an oxymoron, as that DE is extremely rigid. However, you will be cheered if you manage to somehow customize it beyond what is possible by default, for example, coding own Deepin customization. Again, I like Deepin for what it is, but it just doesn‚Äôt fit super well in this sub. Not great for the sub, but I am happy he brought it to my attention, as I didn't know about it before. Deepin is definitively good. I would go as far as saying it is the best DE when switching from both Windows and Mac. BUT they also made some absolute dogshit decisions lately for the sake of touch compatibility, and it is pretty obvious some big dong Chinese corporation is pulling the strings (namely 15.7 to 15.8). Support is straight garbage, EULA is weird, forums are weird. What I am saying, I like it, but I‚Äôm cautious. That's all fair, and good to know. Thanks. Alright. I get your point. I'll be careful in reading the rules next time. Thanks. No worries mate, if you stay here you will be swimming confused in tiling managers in no time :) You know, one day ago a pretty much default looking KDE setup got ~600 upvotes... I want to use Deepin because it's so gorgeous but it's lacking in features. My ideal DE would have the looks of Deepin, the customisability of KDE Plasma and a tiling WM toggle with one quick keyboard shortcut. Well, there is a Deepin like theme for plasma. Replace kwin with i3 for the tiling/floating and you should be pretty close... Deepin, in my opinion, is really great DE for new users in linux world, but not for at least a bit experienced users who want to rice the heck out of their distro. Anyway for the tilling I'd suggest i3wm. Started with deepin on my first arch install, then moved on to plain i3, was great having all those settings included in UI I want to do tiling on some desktops and ""normal""(?) on others. So I can game and work efficiently on the same PC by just rotating between the desktops. Woot woot make your own for ultimate customization / looks ;) Haha, I've never been able to customize Kde to my liking. So i chose DDE I still don't get the trend of blurred and transparent look. I think without the blur and transparency things look much more readable and clean. Blur and transparency also harms performance/snappiness of your desktop. Doesn't that bother anybody ? Am I alone ? That is true. I guess it doesn't bother people and they prefer a good look with a tiny drop in performance. I'd still argue that if u disable transparency in apps like terminal/text editors/file managers it gets much more readable. I feel like some people just transparency/blur everything to the point it looks and reads so bad. For me blur in things like login screen or when u zoom out desktop to workspaces/window manager/launcher that is fine. Still I would be careful in apps themselves because u don't want text on blurred background nor u want it on anything that will stack on top of each other because a) transparency&blur are more like the opposite of background so it defeats the point of itself b) blurring is actually really expansive and if not gpu accelerated then very power/battery hungry so especially bad for laptops. Like if u blur very select few ui elements to me that is fine but if u deeper and ur apps are blurred under the content u looking at to me that is too much. Blur is good when u don't want to see what is behind but u don't want to put a wall there. Agreed. Blur on terminal and file manager is a No from me.

Don't install software from anywhere except the distro's repository, if u don't know what youre doing. Install Timeshift. Its an easy to use backup program, make backup before doing anything with the system files. Restore if it breaks. and keep learning. Specially learn how to restore Timeshift backup normally and also from a live usb. Learn from youtube and if you're on arch based distro (for eg, manjaro) the ArchWiki is your friend. https://wiki.archlinux.org/"

unixporn,[i3wm] Just How I Like It...CLI 'N FUNctional,"Distro: Manjaro Linux WM: i3wm with i3bar Terminal: Termite Browser: Surf Applications: GoTop, Ranger, CMatrix Custom Fonts: Tactic Sans Wallpaper: https://imgur.com/2meWA35 How'd you get those gaps without i3-gaps? You can configure gaps in the normal i3wm too. But for me, with Manjaro, it comes preconfigured with gaps in the config. It's just a matter of changing the gap to your liking. manjaro i3 uses i3-gaps m8 How do you like surf? Only recently was introduced to it, and it sounds like a right pain compared to the comfy Firefox. I tried Surf quite recently too and actually love it now. Getting started is a bit confusing but once you get comfortable with it, it's actually awesome. And it's super fast. And lightweight. And it's suckless. I actually am using it as a secondary browser. If I had to look something up or watch a video on youtube or something. Otherwise, I use firefox. Surf is cool. It is minimal and works well too. Like, I understand the surf is less of a web browser, and more of a ‚Äúwebsite viewer‚Äù Honestly, the complete lack of an interface is almost nice to see‚Äîbut, like all the other suckles projects, looks like a bitch to learn. It actually is relatively easier. At least the basics. If you have dmenu you just type surf to start it. To open a website press ctrl+g and menu opens up and type in your website. Ctrl+h goes through the history. The usual keyboard shortcuts are all there. What we only need is getting used to it. Try looking at the man pages and browse a couple of websites. You may actually like it. Or you type the target website right behind it. Secondly I have a shortcut (Mod+F2) to open surf on Duckduckgo, which is really comfy. I use surf for everything except Google stuff, for which I switch to Chromium."

windows,I won‚Äôt show password page on welcome screen. Can‚Äôt boot into safe mode because no power button welcome page,"You can get into safe mode by holding power during the boot a couple of times. Once windows is convinced that there is a problem with startup, startup repair and the advanced boot menu should launch. From there you have an option to restart with advanced settings. This is where you can get safe mode. Microsoft link - see the section ""From a blank or black screen"" https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode Yes, this is really Microsoft's recommended way to get to safe mode when you can't boot. Ridiculous. I miss having a keyboard shortcut during boot. Alright cool I‚Äôll try it tomorrow it‚Äôs the only thing that makes sense and that you legit proof lol ty I came here to comment this exact thing. Interrupt the boot 3 times and it enters repair mode which you can then use to enter safe mode. If you have a desktop then pressing the reset button would be the easiest way. Putting in a third for this solution. If F8 during boot doesn't get you into safemode, interrupting boot with a hard reset or powering off multiple times certainly will. Edit: If you have another system you can create a recovery key from, you may want to look into booting from USB that has recovery tools on them. If you got an OS disc or USB with your computer that should have those tools as well. Good luck! sorry for this stupid question, but did you try to swipe upwards or press the arrow key up, in order to unlock the welcome screen? yep did all of that i even pressed every key on my keyboard and nothing work tried another USB keyboard ? Sometimes I have to swipe up with the mouse, it's so stupid. Click and pull up this screen. Have you tried ctrl + alt + del? That should bring up the password prompt. Yeah this happens on some machines This right here this might sound farfetched but have you tried with a different keyboard ? maybe some old oem ps2 or usb keyboard (the ones with no lights and bells and whistles), you have lying around ?  or else you could try booting from an installation cd iso and going into repair recovery ->more options->safe mode , these are the first things that i would try in this case, Is it possible there is a second monitor plugged in? If Windows thinks the monitor you are using is not your primary monitor, you will see this behavior. The way the screen goes black when you try to log in makes me think there is a second monitor and Windows is trying to switch to it for the login screen. The issue may be something else, but if you have any other monitors, I would unplug them just to be sure that isn't the issue. This OP try typing your password when the black screen comes up, it'll probably log you in It wont show* Simplest solution might be just to create a bootable Media Creation Tool disk via USB, plug it in, turn on the PC, launch Startup Repair. When you turn it on hold shift and you should be able to do it. Nope doesn‚Äôt work. I usually just restart the computer and press all the F buttons until it boots up in safe mode Have you tried using the mouse? Click and drag up. When you switch on the PC/Laptop. Keep on pressing Ctrl + F10. This should kick start the recovery menu. Ctrl+Alt+Delete Started happening to my work machine a couple days ago. This happened to me before, I just tried my password and hit enter and it worked. I'm not saying that would work for you, but it was interesting. I had a similar problem, my problem was the hard drive was 100% full try booting on external drive and see what's happening with your drives make sure they are completely full You could try using an ubuntu or other bootable Linux distro and use chntpw to add and auto-admin login to the registry. That won't fix this problem but might help you get into the OS to begin fixing the problem. Restart your pc immediately when you see windows logo, you'll get windows repair screen. Navigate to safe mode and see if it works. I work as an IT guy and see this all the time, usually what we do is just reboot and it works again Once I face same issue,better to reinstall OS Once you have logged in, click on reboot from the start button whilst holding shift key and that should be it His whole issue is he can‚Äôt log in????? as a fellow linux user, what the fuck? this person is asking for tech support, not for a different OS. you make linux users look bad lol         A word of advice - joke answers are not well suited for submissions where the OP actually has a problem and is looking for a solution. Because of this, your ""answer"" was downvoted. Downvotes are intended for comments or submissions that do not contribute to the topic in any meaningful way; your ""answer"" falls into that. Also you recommended Linux as a (joke) solution on a Windows subreddit of all places. People didn't get the joke, and often people who recommend Linux as a solution to problems like this don't take into account the user's workflow and set of programs that they use. ""Its just a prank bro!"" In all seriousness, we get a ton of trolls that come to this sub to promote Linux, and doing the exact same thing you did where you make a zero effort post and just link a distro. We have no problem with Linux, and discussion of it is encouraged as long as it is relevant, but in this situation it isn't. I see you already took a beating with downvotes, so I removed your comment to prevent further abuse."

windows,Need help with gpu driver,"You literally can not stop it unless you have Windows 10 Pro. I experienced this exact same issue not too long ago. Windows would install Feb 2018 drivers on me even though I had August 2018 already installed. I first tried the traditional method of disabling automatic install of drivers. That didn't work. The driver would always get messed with and Windows didn't respect that setting. Pro has gpedit so I blocked driver installs based off hardware ID specifically for the IGPU. If you need a guide: https://www.maketecheasier.com/block-driver-updates-specific-devices-windows10/ This solved it. It errored every time it tried to install. The only caveat now is you have to disable policy to manually update. Which isn't a big deal to me. However, the fact that I had to do this is a testament to the bad practice of forced updates. Edit: That link actually has a registry method. I forgot that was possible. I've lived with Pro for so long (since 7) I make changes with gpedit because it's far easier than dicking around creating entries."
windows,Can't get out of Windows 10 S mode because network adaptors deleted,Possible option is to connect your phone and tether via USB to reinstall the drivers through windows update or at very least disable S mode. That is if the driver can be installed directly from the phone during connection. Only other option I can think of if this dosent work is to try reinstalling windows from a backup/recovery or from the settings menu if recovery is not available. You didn't re-install it you just reset it with the built in recovery partition. If you install it from bootable media it will give you the option to install any version you want. https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4456067/windows-10-switch-out-of-s-mode Thanks but I cant do this option because the laptop can't get to the internet so the store wont work.

Also problem occurs even without her pressing any keys she says so don't think the ctrl+alt+left/up/right hotkeys is the problem,  however I did show her how to use ctrl+alt+up to fix it whenever it happens next time, I also disabled some sensor service in services.msc where it said in the description it controls auto-rotation, we'll see how it goes I guess from now on ! atleast she knows now how to fix it with ctrl+alt+up arrow, cheers"

windows,Transferring Windows Keys,"To check version go to system (through control panel or right click on computer in start menu and choose properties). Doesn't really matter what it was on his old machine though since the key should work for both 32 or 64 bit. Use Magic Jelly Bean key finder to extract windows key. Of course if current key is an OEM key (provided with pre-built system) then technically you're not allowed to transfer it to a new machine. It might still let you though. You could also use the key with the windows 10 installer to get windows 10 if you want to upgrade to that while you're at it. What‚Äôs magic jelly bean? First, if you want to check the version of Windows, go to Control Panel and system. Second, make sure that the license if a rental one, not an OEM one."
windows,Short freezes when launching applications and broken Netflix in Chrome (1809),"I always just use the Nvidia drivers that comes though Windows Update. The few times I have tried the cutting edge 300+ MB Nvidia drivers that includes a ton of crap I don't need, there has always been more issues than benefits. Just a tip. Have you tried using Firefox instead? No, but using Edge just for Netflix already made a difference. I just mention it since it started to act up at the same the freezes started, so it might be related. Chrome on Linux does not have these problems, so that seems to be a platform specific problem. Works fine for me on 1809 with all updates. Tested it on 2 desktops and my laptop. are you on an NVIDIA or AMD graphics card? and is one of the desktops a multi monitor setup? Nvidia cards, both desktops are multi-monitor. One is a GTX 660 hooked up to a 60hz 32"" 720p TV and a 1080P 75hz 19"" monitor. The other is a GTX 1060 hooked up to a 144Hz curved 27"" FreeSync display and a 120Hz 24"" ASUS 3D Display The laptop is an ancient Nvidia QuadroFX1800 Chrome can only muster 720p anyway (see HTML5 section of the Netflix page listed below). I would suggest uninstalling chrome and sticking to Edge or Firefox. If you aren't comfortable with that, maybe uninstall chrome and install chromium?  Also, have you checked the Windows Reliability History? Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Security and Maintenance\Reliability Monitor  https://help.netflix.com/en/node/23742 Short freezes, like the mouse cursor stops responding? If so I have been experiencing this as well. It also takes 10 seconds to create a new folder. Netflix running in chrome makes my entire PC hitch every few seconds (gtx1080, i7 8700k). Amazon video, YouTube, and using other browsers for Netflix are all fine."
windows,Upgraded my motherboard and it came with no network adapters drivers and now I keep running into problems,"If you need drivers, youre going to have to get drivers. Download on your phone, stick on usb, transfer. Go to a friends place and download. Go to a library and download. Bro I did this. It won't work, I've been trying every thing since five pm yesterday. It's now 1:56 Am. I get a realtek network controller was not found. I looked through almost everything on the fix. This Reddit is my last hope Have you tried looking for drivers at the motherboard manufacturers website? Which motherboard do you have? Yes I have, I have the asrock AB350M-HDV Have you tried the Realtek Lan driver ver:10023 that was released 3 days ago and can be found on https://www.asrock.com/MB/AMD/AB350M-HDV/index.asp#osW1064 yes of course i did, i get the the realtek network controller was not found error and non of the fixes work. I must be experiences a very new issue or an issue that people dont experience alot. When I Googled ""asrock AB350M-HDV no network"" I found articles going back to 2017, but they all basically tell people to just install the Realtek network drivers. Have you tried going into Device Manager and uninstalling/removing the device, and then reboot? Does it show up as an unknown device in Device Manager? Yes, Ive tried everything in those articles. Im unlucky and I dont recieve the unknown device thing. I even hit show hidden items and it wasnt there. Well it's 08:25 here so I'm just starting - What is your target OS Win 7, 8.1, 10? I am assuming Windows 10 with how you have described 'settings' and 'resetting you pc' When you replaced the mainboard, did you remove any/all associated drivers, chipset drivers etc before or did you replace as is with old software in-place? It does however, sound like it can't find the recovery partition which would normally be created during first time installation or if it is an OEM PC, they would definitely have that as it contains standard programs they bundle etc. If there is no recovery partition, you will have to get USB media from another source and do a clean install. As mentioned, you may have to beg, borrow or otherwise in order to complete this part unfortunately. Good luck! I might have to get a USB To Ethernet Adapter, do you know if those take away any speed? EDIT: I have Windows 10 and Im using my SSD that used a migrate thing to move my windows too. USB 3.0 Ethernet adaptors should do 1Gbps easily. Though if there is a fault on the MB you should contact the retailer and replace it. ok, thanks. boutta get one."
windows,What was the first Windows version to collect telemetry data?,"You seem to vastly miss understand what telemetry is. The only valid comment. However ""sensitive"" your records are, I'm sure there are companies with much more sensitive data who routinely use Microsoft products with telemetry. You aren't some special snowflake. How did this thread end with me being a special snowflake? All I was asking was which the first version of Windows was that collected telemetry data. Because you're acting like you're the only person who has to store business records too sensitive for a normal Windows installation. Is there a specific reason you need Windows on that machine? While i'm generally not one to try ""convert people"", this sounds like the perfect job for linux... I‚Äôd like it if I could put Linux on there too, but I‚Äôd prefer if I could write the entire documents on the same computer using Microsoft Office. I mean, you already said, that the machine wouldn't have internet access. You ""could"" use a software that basically write Protects the System HDD. There are several tools that mainly schools and such use. They allow you changes to the HDD while logged in, but on logout or shutdown, the HDD will be reset to a predetermined state.  If you actually go back to windows 95 or 98 or such, you will also face problems with obtaining a Office version that will actually run under those OS's. Drivers will be a hassle too. Even if those existed back then, you'll have to do some digging in the Internet to actually obtain those (most came on CD or Floppy back then and wheren't available online).  TL;DR: For anything but Retrogaming or Nostalgia i wouldn't look into anything older than Windows 7. Windows 7 can be configured to collect minimal/no data. Add no Internet Connection and an optional program to reset you OS Drive on Reboot and there shouldn't be to much persistent data on that machine.  Or, Linux plus Libre Office. Libre Office is on par with MS Office when creating documents. Only when you want to use Documents on Libre Office AND MS Office you run into the occasional Formatting weirdness. Other than that, they are basically on par (especially when you want to run a compatible Office Version on Windows 95, which will be equally old)... Windows 1.0 maybe Probably a version of windows with no internet support. Most OSes even older ones will have some form of telemetry included Telemetry means: Person 12230983 went to setting by clicking start and clicking settings icon. person 24389328 got to settings by typing settings in search. no user used the fax program so we removed it.  they aren't stealing your documents."
